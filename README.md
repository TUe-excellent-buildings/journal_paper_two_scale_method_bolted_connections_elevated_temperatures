This repository provides all code and scripts needed to reproduce the finite element simulations presented in:

Xu Q; Hofmeyer H; Maljaars J: A two-scale method to include essential behaviour of bolted connections in structures including elevated temperatures, Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters.

The code and scripts have been provided by Qingfeng Xu, fall under his responsibility, and have not been checked on the code level by coauthors and/or supervisors.
